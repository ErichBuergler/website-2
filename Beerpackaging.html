                    The fact that consumers often buy beer in single-use glass is problematic for the environment. The eco-balance of disposable glass is poor - even if it is recycled. This is due to the weight and the high temperatures at which used glass is melted down: 1,600 degrees are needed for this - a big and now expensive waste of energy.

                <p> <h3>Study shows clear results</h3>
                    A study commissioned by the Federal Office for the Environment concluded for Switzerland: "Disposable glass bottles are definitely among the beverage packaging with the highest environmental impact." The results apply to beer consumption at home and were extrapolated to 1 liter. The environmental impact is measured in environmental impact points. 

For comparison: 300 environmental impact points
correspond to:

- Production of 9 g beef
- Use of laptop 9 hrs.
- Car journey 1.5 km (with an average load of 1.6 persons).

The values were calculated according to average transport routes and the recycling rates in Switzerland. The ranges result from uncertainties in the valuation methods. The most probable value lies in the middle.

                    While restaurants and bars mainly sell beer in reusable glasses, 
                    the wholesalers and discounters hardly do so any more. 
                    Twenty years ago, returnable glass was also very common 
                    in supermarkets. But in the meantime, the share of reusable
                     bottles has declined sharply overall. 
                     Beer in cans and disposable bottles, on the other hand, is more popular.
                      This is shown by data from the Swiss Brewers Association.
                       Meanwhile, glass bottles in general are becoming scarce. One reason
                        for this is the war in Ukraine. 
                        The Swiss glass manufacturer Vetropack operated a glass factory there with 600 employees. The company had to stop production. The 
                        rising popularity of disposable glass is adding to the glass shortage.

                        <p> <h3>Environmentally conscious beer drinkers have two options</h3>
                            Anyone who drinks beer and wants to pay attention
                            to the environmental impact should buy reusable bottles. 
                            According to the study, beer in cans is also recommended in this respect. The low weight of aluminium brings
                            advantages. The eco-balance of disposable bottles is significantly worse and therefore the worst option.
